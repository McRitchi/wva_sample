# get_rev.sh (final name TBD) is a script which parses
# through this file, removing all lines which are comments
# (begin with a #) or are blank/empty (contain only spaces, or
# nothing at all); then pipes that output through head(1) to
# extract just the first character. This is why there is just
# a single letter on its own just below: it represents the
# build rev for the sample app.

# Build Rev:
B

# More comments can appear below; they are irrelevant.
